# Netflix-Clone
This project is a simplified version of Netflix, built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It replicates the basic functionalities and layout of Netflix, allowing users to browse through a selection of movies and TV shows and watch trailers.

User Interface: The project mimics the layout and design of Netflix, providing a familiar browsing experience for users.
Catalog Display: Users can view a collection of movie and TV show thumbnails organized in rows, similar to Netflix's interface.
Modal Popups: Clicking on a thumbnail opens a modal popup displaying more details about the selected title, including a synopsis and trailer (if available).
Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
